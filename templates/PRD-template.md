# [Feature Name] — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Applies to:** [Product area(s), module(s), or platform(s) this feature affects.]

**Status:** [Draft | In review | Approved | Implemented — and any scope note.]

Reference: [Spec Doc](./[feature-name]-spec.md) (summary, problems, features, user flows).

---

## Problem statement(s)

1. **[Problem 1 title]** — [One or two sentences: who has the problem, what they need, and what happens today without this feature.]
2. **[Problem 2 title]** — [Same structure as above.]
_Add or remove numbered items as needed._

---

## Goals & non-goals

### Goals

- [Goal 1: outcome or capability the feature will enable.]
- [Goal 2.]
- [Goal 3.]
_Use clear, outcome-focused bullets._

### Non-goals (this initiative)

- [Explicitly out of scope for this PRD — e.g. "X is future work" or "Y is covered by another spec."]
- [Another non-goal.]
_Reduces scope creep and sets expectations._

---

## Assumptions & risks

### Assumptions

| Assumption | Notes |
|------------|--------|
| [Assumption 1] | [How you'll validate or what it depends on.] |
| [Assumption 2] | [Notes.] |
_Add rows as needed._

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [How you'll mitigate.] |
| [Risk 2] | [Mitigation.] |
_Add rows as needed._

### Riskiest assumptions

1. **[Riskiest assumption 1.]**  
   **Validation:** [How you'll validate — usage, survey, interviews, etc.]  
   **Learning success if adoption is low (or assumption is wrong):** [What you'll learn and do next.]

2. **[Riskiest assumption 2.]**  
   **Validation:** [How you'll validate.]  
   **Learning success if insufficient:** [What you'll do with the signal.]

---

## User personas

- **[Persona 1 name] (primary)** — [Role and context. Need that this feature addresses.]
- **[Persona 2 name] (secondary)** — [Role and need.]
_Adjust primary/secondary as needed._

---

## User stories

1. **As a [persona],** I want to [action/capability] so that [outcome/benefit].
2. **As a [persona],** I want to [action/capability] so that [outcome/benefit].
_Numbered list; cover main flows and outcomes._

---

## Functional requirements

_Group by theme (e.g. data model, add/edit, delete, reports, persistence). Use consistent IDs (FR-1, FR-2, …)._

### [Theme 1 — e.g. Data model and core behavior]

- **FR-1** [Requirement statement — testable and unambiguous.]
- **FR-2** [Next requirement.]
- **FR-3** [Continue.]

### [Theme 2 — e.g. Add / create flow]

- **FR-4** [Requirement.]
- **FR-5** [Requirement.]

### [Theme 3 — e.g. Edit / delete / visibility]

- **FR-6** [Requirement.]

### [Theme 4 — e.g. Reports or export]

- **FR-7** [Requirement.]

### [Theme 5 — e.g. Persistence and scope]

- **FR-8** [Requirement.]

_Add or remove themes and FRs to match the feature. Ensure no duplicate FR numbers._

---

## Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-1** [Performance, scale, or latency expectation.]
- **NFR-2** [Consistency, accuracy, or quality expectation.]
- **NFR-3** [UX or accessibility alignment — e.g. "Patterns align with existing product conventions."]
_Add NFRs as needed._

---

## Dependencies & constraints

- **[Dependency or system 1]** — [How this feature depends on it or integrates.]
- **[Dependency or system 2]** — [Description.]
_List technical, product, or org dependencies and constraints._

---

## Success metrics & measurement plan

### Adoption

- **Usage:** [What you'll measure — e.g. sessions with feature, frequency of use, share of users.]
- **Measurement:** [How — instrumentation, events, optional survey.]

### Value

- **Outcome:** [e.g. Time saved, errors reduced, decisions improved.]
- **Measurement:** [How you'll measure value — before/after, survey, interviews.]

---

## MVP definition and hypothesis

**MVP scope (this iteration):** [Concise list of what's in scope: capabilities, platforms, and any explicit limits.]

**Hypothesis:** [One sentence: we believe that [users] will [behavior] so that [outcome].]

**Learning success if adoption is low:** [What would indicate we need to pivot — e.g. discoverability, different workflows, or more scope before further investment.]

---

## Open questions / risks (for validation)

- **[Open question 1]** — [Brief context or owner.]
- **[Open question 2]** — [Context.]
_List items that need validation or a decision before or during implementation._
